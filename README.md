Part of the Project: Recipes section in Fundamentals.

__08/19/22__

This project concerns the creation of a basic recipe website using various HTML features as well as my narrow understanding of Git. At the project's conclusion, I will expect to have learned how to:
    * create a website's front-end structure with headings, paragraphs, bolding and emphasis, as well as several links and images 
    * further my understanding of HTML and Git
