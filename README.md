Part of the Project: Recipes section in Fundamentals.

This project concerns the creation of a basic recipe website using various HTML features as well as my narrow understanding of Git. At the project's conclusion, I will expect to have learned how to:
- create a website's front-end structure with headings, paragraphs, bolding and emphasis, as well as several links and images 
- further my understanding of HTML and Git

I have added CSS to all of my webpages as a result of the new knowledge I gained.
The pages don't look perfect, but they do look much better than the blank, black-on-white HTML-only pages I had before.
