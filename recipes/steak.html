        <p>For the show's sixth meal, Shirou Emiya prepares a delicious Hamburg steak

            <li>400g (0.88 lbs.) ground meat (70/30 or 60/40 beef/pork)</li>

            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. ketchup</li>
                <li>1 tsp. coarse mustard</li>
                <li>(optional): 2 tbsp. sake</li>
                <li>(optional): 5g (1 tsp.) butter</li>
                <li>(optional): pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>[B] Onion Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 onion</li>
                <li>1 small clove garlic</li>
                <li>3 tbsp. soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tbsp. vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparing Onion Sauce</h3>
        <p>First, mince the onion, then add garlic. Put olive oil in a pan
            and saute garlic over low heat, making sure not to burn. Lastly,
            add the onion, soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar to pan. Sauce is ready
            when it begins to boil. 
        </p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a dash of salt to minced onion and saute slowly over low heat
                until light brown, then chill. Mince half an onion and leave raw.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt to still-chilled ground meat in a bowl and mix
                thoroughly until it begins to stick. </li>
            <li>Once meat begins to stick, add bread crumbs, egg, raw onions from [1],
                pepper, and nutmeg (1-2 dashes), and mix. Split mixtures in fourths
                and make them into 1.5 cm (0.6 in) thick patties by tossing from palm
                to palm to remove any air. </li>
            <li>Refrigerate formed patties for 30 minutes, letting them sit. (Keeps umami
                and fat while cooking)</li>
            <li>Heat frying pan with oil, then cook patties over medium-low heat (high heat
                causes patties to shrink.) Once bottom is firm, bring heat to low for 3 minutes.
                Once edges turn white, flip and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn heat off and cover with lid or aluminum foil and let sit for 2-3 minutes to
                allow heat to penetrate the patty. Turn heat back on, then cook for another 2
                minutes or more.</li>
            <li>Pierce patty with skewer. If juice runs clear, patties are finished cooking. Cook
                for an additional 15 seconds to sear them, and patties are done. 
            </li>
        </ol>
