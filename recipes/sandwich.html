        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Appearing in <em>Today's Menu for the Emiya Family</em>'s fourth episode,
        these sandwiches are the hallmark of simplicity, but do not lack for flavor
        or aroma. They can be enjoyed by just about anyone, whether they be an aloof 
        highschool student or a vigilant Servant.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

            <li>12 pcs. long bacon (16-18 if shorter
                than bread slices</li>
            <li>cooking oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>[A] Spicy Mustard Butter
            <ul>
                <li>~2-4g (0.07-0.14 oz) Japanese spicy mustard</li>
                <li>50g butter/margarine (1.75 oz)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>[B] Sandwich Sauce
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tbsp. mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp. coarse mustard</li>
                    <li>2/3 tsp. honey</li>
                    <li>coarse pepper</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring ingredients in <strong>[A]</strong> to room temp,
            then mix to create a spicy mustard spread for the bread. 
            Mix the ingredients in <strong>[B]</strong> to create sauce
            for sandwiches.</li>
            <li>Boil field mustard for 1-2 minutes in salted water, then
            transfer to ice water. Dry off with paper towels once cooled. 
            (! Don't keep greens in cold water too long, or they lose
            their flavor)</li>
            <li>Add salt to eggs, then scramble in frying pan. (Don't let
            eggs separate or clump too much)</li>
            <li>Cook bacon in large amount of oil over low-medium heat until
            brown and crispy. Transfer to paper towels once finished. Wipe
            off excess oil (! Have care, excess oil splatters easily)</li>
            <li>Spread spicy mustard butter over one side of a loaf of white
            bread, then add ingredients in following order from the bottom up:
            bacon, field mustard, <strong>[B]</strong> sauce, eggs, second loaf.
            Things to Note:
            </li>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange bacon tighly so vegetables do not touch bread</li>
                <li>Placing crispier ingredients on the bottom to make sandwich
                easier to cut.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Wrap sandwiches in plastic wrap. Lightly place flat object on top
            to hold sandwich in place for 5-10 minutes, allowing ingredients to mix.
            Slice and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
